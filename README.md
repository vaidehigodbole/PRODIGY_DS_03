In this project, a decision tree classifier was built and evaluated to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. The workflow involved loading and encoding the data, followed by splitting it into training and test sets. A decision tree was trained and its performance was evaluated using accuracy and classification report metrics. Additionally, the decision tree was visualized to provide insights into the model's decision-making process. This project effectively demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to real-world data.
